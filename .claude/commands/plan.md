Enter Plan Mode for: $ARGUMENTS

Read relevant user stories from docs/prd/.
Read the schema from src/db/schema.ts.
Read the UI specs from docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md.

Propose a detailed implementation plan with:
1. Files to create/modify (with full paths)
2. Components needed (new or existing to reuse)
3. Server Actions needed (with function signatures)
4. Validation schemas needed (Zod schemas with fields)
5. Unit tests needed (list each test file and what scenarios it tests)
6. E2E scenarios if this completes an Epic
7. Edge cases to handle
8. Potential risks or blockers
9. Estimated complexity (S/M/L)

DO NOT CODE until I approve the plan.

After approval, you can proceed with implementation using `/implement-us`.
